= Hibernate object lifecycle

Hibernate objects can live in 4 states:

* transient
* persistent
* detached
* removed

Transient objects :: not managed by Hibernate at all.

Persistent objects :: exist in the database and Hibernate can manage them.

Detached object :: has a representation in the database, but any changes on the object will not be reflected in the database and vice-versa.

Removed object :: state occurs when object is deleted from both the session and the database.

== Methods to transfer between states

There are few methods to manage lifecycle of an object.

* transient -> persistent: `save()`, `saveOrUpdate()`
* persistent -> detached: `evict()`, `clear()`, `close()`
* detached -> persistent: `update()`, `merge()`, `saveOrUpdate()`
* persistent -> removed: `delete()`
