= Hibernate object lifecycle

Hibernate objects can live in 4 states:

* transient
* persistent
* detached
* removed

Transient objects are not managed by Hibernate at all.
Persistent object exist in the database and Hibernate can manage it.
Detached object has a representation in the database, but any changes on the object will not be reflected in the database, and vice-versa.
Removed state occurs when object is deleted from session and database.

There are few methods to manage lifecycle of an object.

* transient -> persistent: `save()`, `saveOrUpdate()`
* persistent -> detached: `evict()`, `clear()`, `close()`
* detached -> persistent: `update()`, `merge()`, `saveOrUpdate()`
* persistent -> removed: `delete()`

Go to App class to see hibernate object lifecycle.
